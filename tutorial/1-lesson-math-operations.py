#Here is first lesson a brief demonstration how python calculate math equation

#Add two numbers
print("Add 2+2 =", 2+2)

#Prority of operation examlpe
print("Equation 10 + 2*3 =", 10+2*3)

#Divasion, the result is awlays float number
print("Equation 22/7 =",22/7)

#Here is divasion that discard the fraction
print("Discard fraction divide 22//7 =",22//7)

#Here is power calculation in python **
print("This is 2 power of 8: 2**8 =", 2**8)

#The reminder of divasion
print("This give only reminder of division 17%5 =", 17%5)

#Assign a variable
long = 10
width = 20
high = 20

volume = long * high * width

print("The volume", volume)

#Last example is for last printed expresion stored in _
ratio = 100/2
print("The ratio 100/2=", ratio)
#print("The ratio * 2.4=", _ * 2.4) #if you uncoment the line you will see thath this will give you a error
#but if you use it in python console this will print last printed variable
